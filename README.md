• Blood Donation: This App will use Google location services. The donors will register to the App with their blood group. (Also the App can make use of Emitra API for fetching any useful information like Address etc). The App will have a broadcast request option where any user can request for a specific blood type. The App will match the donors in the nearby vicinity (Google location) and send out a broadcast SMS to these donors to donate blood at a nearby govt hospital.  

• Book Doctor Appointments:  Here users can check the schedule of relevant govt hospital doctors and book an appointment with them. To make it easier for uneducated people having trouble to use the App, there will be an alternate IVR using which they can schedule appointments.

• Digitize Health Records:  Many a times, we travel out of station and we end up falling sick too. The doctors there ask for various medical reports and scans to be performed. Wouldn't it be very useful if we could upload these medicals records on cloud. As a result we can prevent lot of redundant tasks and speedup up medication process.
